# Generative AI Agents and Automation for Business Professionals

This course is designed to give business professionals a **practical, hands-on introduction to generative AI**.

Over the span of the program, you will explore how AI can streamline workflows, enhance decision-making, and unlock new business opportunities. The focus is not just on theory but on **real-world applications** that you can directly apply to your work.

In the early weeks, you’ll get familiar with **ChatGPT, generative AI platforms, and AI-powered business tools**. As the course progresses, we’ll dive into **no-code automation** using platforms like n8n, and you’ll learn how to **design, build, and deploy AI agents** that integrate with everyday tools such as Gmail, Google Calendar, social media, web search engines, and more.

By the end of the course, you’ll have built several **mini AI projects**, including:

- **AI-powered business advisors**
- **Customer support chatbots** that can respond to emails using company-specific data
- **Deep research agents** capable of synthesizing insights from multiple sources

The goal of this course is twofold:

1. To **inspire ideas** about what’s possible with generative AI in business  
2. To give you the **skills to prototype and deploy AI agents** that bring real value to your organization
