# Generative AI for beginners (6 week course)

This course is a practical, hands-on introduction to generative AI for beginners. You'll learn by doing through small, guided exercises that deliver quick wins. No coding required - when we do write code, we rely on AI helpers or no-code tools to keep things simple.

We start with ChatGPT basics and core LLM ideas (how models work, costs, and safe use). Then you'll explore popular research and document tools, try multimodal features (images, audio, video), and build simple, useful artifacts - like a one-page site, a tiny app, and a basic AI agent.

Who it's for: learners with no prior AI or programming experience who want practical skills they can use immediately at work.

Course goals:
1. Build confidence with quick, applied wins.
2. Master clear prompting and fast model selection.
3. Practice safe, verifiable workflows (costs, citations, limits).
4. Ship small automations and assets you can reuse.
