KURSUOK: AI For Business Professionals (6–8 Weeks, 54–72 academic hours)

Assumption: 1 academic hour = 45 minutes. Each week targets ≈9 academic hours via two 3-hour live sessions (6 hours = 8 academic hours) + a 45–60 min guided lab/clinic. Minor variation is fine based on cohort needs.

Why 6 vs 8 weeks
- 6 weeks: Faster momentum, strong “hook” into upsell, lower attrition. Best for busy teams and pilot cohorts.
- 8 weeks: More practice time, deeper automation and evaluation, higher internal adoption. Best when you want tangible team change and portfolio-quality capstones.

Target audience and outcomes
- Audience: Everyday business users in marketing, sales, ops, HR, finance, support. No coding required.
- Outcomes: Confident, safe use of modern AI for research, writing, analysis, vision tasks, simple prototypes, and light automation. Capstone delivered and a clear path to the advanced program.

Tools covered (modern and practical)
- ChatGPT (GPT‑4o/GPT‑4.1/GPT‑4o mini), Vision, Code Interpreter-style data tools.
- Gemini 1.5 in Google AI Studio, Gemini for Workspace (if available).
- Perplexity for research with citations.
- NotebookLM for personal/Team knowledge work.
- AI builders: ChatGPT GPTs (custom GPTs + actions), Google AI Studio app templates.
- Prototyping: GitHub Copilot (for light scripts and scaffolds), Lovable.dev (no‑code apps).
- Automation: n8n intro, calendar agent, RAG-style “Ask my docs”.
- Note on OpenAI Codex: Codex is deprecated; we use GitHub Copilot + current GPT‑4o capabilities as the modern replacement.

Accounts and setup (pre-course checklist)
- ChatGPT Plus/Team or Enterprise; Google account with AI Studio + NotebookLM access; Perplexity; GitHub with Copilot trial; n8n Cloud trial or local; Google Calendar/Drive; Slack/Teams (optional).
- Privacy: Never upload sensitive/regulated data to consumer tools; prefer Team/Enterprise offerings with data controls; use redaction where needed.

6‑Week Accelerator (≈54 academic hours)

  - Labs: Weekly report generator; Data cleanup from CSV; Slide QA with Vision.
- Week 4 — Prototyping Without Code
  - AI builders: ChatGPT GPTs (actions, instructions, knowledge), Google AI Studio app templates.
  - Lovable.dev quick app (e.g., feedback → insights dashboard). Copilot for tiny scripts (CSV parsing, simple Streamlit skeleton) for the curious.
  - Labs: Build a simple app in Lovable.dev; “CSV → insights” via Copilot-assisted notebook (optional).
- Week 5 — Automation and Calendar Agent (n8n)
  - n8n building blocks, triggers, error handling, guardrails. Add AI steps to flows.
  - Guided project: Email → extract intent/constraints → find free slots (Google Calendar) → propose times → confirm meeting.
  - Labs: Calendar agent v1; Slack/Email summaries and notifications.
- Week 6 — RAG‑Lite in n8n + Capstone
  - RAG for business users: what it is, when to use, pitfalls. n8n “Ask my docs” pattern using Google Drive/Docs + LLM summarization and citation references.
  - Capstone build and demo; ROI pitch: time saved, quality uplift, error reduction.
  - Labs: “Ask HR policy” workflow; Capstone polish and presentation.

8‑Week Extend (≈72 academic hours)
- Week 1 — Foundations + Safety + Vision Deep Dive
  - Prompt reliability; response grading; red‑teaming basics. Vision: document QA, whiteboards → tasks.
- Week 2 — Research Mastery
  - Perplexity strategies (query laddering, scope control); NotebookLM advanced notebooks and templated briefs.
- Week 3 — Content and Data
  - Long‑form drafting with outlines; revision passes; data analysis with Code Interpreter; structured JSON outputs for downstream use.
- Week 4 — Prototyping with Builders
  - ChatGPT GPTs with actions; Google AI Studio apps; Lovable.dev form → dashboard; Copilot micro‑scripts with safety nets.
- Week 5 — Automation Fundamentals + Calendar Agent
  - n8n architecture, retries, error branches, security. Calendar agent build + edge cases and testing matrix.
- Week 6 — RAG with n8n (Deeper)
  - Chunking, metadata, prompt injection defenses, citation mapping. Optional vector store (e.g., Qdrant/Pinecone via HTTP) or n8n Data Store. Versioning your knowledge base.
- Week 7 — Evaluation, Adoption, and Governance
  - Prompt A/B checks, rubric scoring, acceptance criteria. Usage policies, privacy, change management, team enablement, license choices.
- Week 8 — Capstone Week
  - Personal AI Workstation: 1 custom GPT or Gemini app + 1 n8n workflow (calendar agent or report generator) + 1 NotebookLM knowledge assistant. Demos and impact metrics.

Deliverables and assessments
- Weekly labs saved as shareable artifacts (prompts, GPTs, n8n workflows).
- Capstone with before/after metrics and a 3‑slide ROI story.
- Rubric: effectiveness, safety, repeatability, and time saved.

Explicit coverage of requested topics
- ChatGPT; Vision usage; Gemini and Google AI Studio; Perplexity; NotebookLM; AI builders (GPTs, AI Studio apps); Prototypes with GitHub Copilot; Lovable.dev; n8n intro; n8n calendar agent; RAG with n8n. Note: OpenAI Codex is legacy; we map to modern Copilot/GPT‑4o workflows.
